*news digests from Russian media*

above, you can find some code written in apps script which runs through rss feeds saved in this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xgD1MqXMpUEMwPWXOYi7vyYpAA_lDo_xGwfNl8m5t8c/edit?usp=sharing) and sends you a news digest coming from various regions of Russia.
it comes in two versions: Russian (original) and English (translated with google translate).

many thanks to [yuki-shinno](https://github.com/yuki-shinno/RSS-to-email-script-by-GoogleAppsScript), who gave me the idea for the skeleton code, and my [dad](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jo%C5%BEe-snoj-64452648/), who helped me solve some systematic issues.

my personal preferences: 

* "Russia" lands in my inbox on Monday
* "European Russia" comes on Wednesday
* "Siberia - Far East" comes on Friday

these digests are accesible in this online [archive](https://cho-tam.blogspot.com/). You can subscribe to it via feedburner or just follow the [Twitter bot](https://twitter.com/chotam10) which tweets links to new posts. or you can just use this code and adjust it to your own preferences!

any suggestions are more than welcome. just contact me via this [email](veronika.snoj@gmail.com)
