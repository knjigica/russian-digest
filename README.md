# russian-digest
*a compilation of news digests running through Russian media*

above, you can find some code written in apps script which runs through rss feeds saved in this [google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1xgD1MqXMpUEMwPWXOYi7vyYpAA_lDo_xGwfNl8m5t8c/edit?usp=sharing) and sends you a news digest from various regions of Russia

the treshold set 

my personal preferences: 

* "All Russia" lands in my inbox on Monday
* "European Russia - Caucasus" comes on Wednesday
* "Siberia - Far East" comes on Friday
* "YouTube - Podcasts" comes on Sunday

these digests are accesible in an online [archive](https://cho-tam.blogspot.com/). You can subscribe to it via the rss feed or just follow the Twitter bot which gives you a link to any new post.

a version with google translated headlines still has to be built

any suggestions are more than welcome! just contact me via this [email](veronika.snoj@gmail.com)
